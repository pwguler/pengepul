# 1. Replace the ProviderId enum with a {kind, id} struct

Status: Accepted

## Context

Provider identity does two unrelated jobs. It selects behavior — which account
manager holds the credentials, which OAuth flow mints the token, which
translator reshapes the body, which parser reads usage off the stream — and it
names a provider on the outside, as the directory under the auth dir holding
that provider's tokens and as the string `/v1/models` reports in `owned_by`.

For anthropic and codex those two jobs collapse onto one string, so a
closed `enum ProviderId { Anthropic, Codex }` carries both. It stops
carrying both the moment behavior and naming stop being one-to-one.
Taking pengepul to roughly thirty upstreams means fifteen or so
OpenAI-compatible API-key services — groq, mistral, deepseek, openrouter and the
rest — sharing one header builder, one translator and one auth model while
needing fifteen distinct credential directories. An enum variant is a line of
Rust. groq is a base URL and a key.

## Decision

`ProviderId` at `src/types.rs:45-49` pairs a closed `ProviderKind` enum with an
`Arc<str>` id. `kind` drives behavior and nothing else: the account manager pick
in `src/app.rs`, the auth URL and callback endpoint in `src/runtime.rs`, the
on-disk `token_type` discriminator frozen at the v0.1 names in `src/tokens.rs`. `id` drives
naming and nothing else: `storage_dir()` returns it, `tokens::save_token` joins
it onto `auth_dir`, and `Display` prints it. No `id` value reaches control flow.
Behavior stays closed and exhaustively matched. Identity stays open.

There is a third shape. Keeping the enum and giving one variant a payload,
`GenericOpenAi(Arc<str>)`, pays the same loss of `Copy` the struct pays, but
leaves the id reachable only through a method that fabricates a string for every
other variant. The struct spends that cost once and gets a field every provider
can be asked for.

## Consequences

- `ProviderId` derives `Clone` and not `Copy`. Its references settle
  clone-versus-borrow per call site rather than once: `next_provider_account`
  takes the id by value. `Arc<str>` keeps a clone down to a refcount bump,
  asserted by `provider_id_clone_shares_arc`.
- Every kind has exactly one id, equal to `kind.canonical_id()`.
  `ProviderId::new` has no caller outside `src/types.rs`, and `FromStr` derives
  the id from the parsed kind, so the field reads as a heap copy of the enum's
  own name, and reading `src/types.rs` cold gives no hint why it exists.
  (Superseded for configured providers by ADR-0011: a `Generic` kind's id comes
  from the `providers:` config entry name, so `Generic` has many ids.)
- The layout on disk binds to `id`; the discriminator inside the file binds to
  `kind`. `save_token` writes `<auth_dir>/<id>/<email>.json`, `load_all_tokens`
  picks the directory by `id` and then keeps a file only when the kind it
  rebuilds matches, and `storage_to_token` rebuilds that kind from `token_type`
  while ignoring the directory it came from. Two instances of one kind are
  indistinguishable on the read path.
- The type admits a second instance of a kind. Nothing constructs one:
  `ProviderId` values are built from their fixed kinds, and `src/config.rs` has
  no provider concept, so an instance declared outside Rust has nothing that
  constructs it. (Superseded for configured providers by ADR-0011: the
  `providers:` config section constructs a `Generic` ProviderId per entry.)
- Adding a kind stops the compiler at every behavior site. `ProviderKind` is
  closed, so the exhaustive `match` arms in `app.rs`, `runtime.rs` and
  `tokens.rs` are the checklist for the work. That property is the reason not to
  reach for a trait object or a bare string tag.
